This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: unexpected comparison results due to trailing spaces in alphanumeric fields. The bug.cob file shows a comparison that fails due to unnoticed trailing spaces.  The bugSolution.cob file offers a corrected version using the INSPECT statement to handle trailing spaces before comparison.  This ensures accurate comparisons and improves the reliability of conditional logic in COBOL.
